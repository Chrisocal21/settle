# Connection System - Drag-to-Connect Conveyors

## How to Use

Instead of placing conveyor cards, you can now create connections between buildings:

### Creating a Connection
1. **Hold Shift** and **click on a source building** (miner, extractor, storage, smelter, etc.)
2. A **yellow circle** will appear on the source building
3. A **yellow banner** will appear at the bottom saying "Connection Mode"
4. **Hold Shift** and **click on the destination building**
5. A **green dashed line** will appear connecting the two buildings

### Canceling a Connection
- Click anywhere without holding Shift to cancel

### How Connections Work
- Resources automatically transfer from source to destination at 1 item/second
- The connection transfers any resources in the source's storage
- Only transfers if the destination has space
- Green dashed lines show active connections with dots at each end

## Features
- Visual connection lines (green dashed lines)
- Connection mode indicator (yellow banner at bottom)
- Source building highlighted with yellow circle
- Automatic resource transfer every game tick
- No conveyor cards needed!

## Example Uses
- Connect miner → storage building to auto-collect resources
- Connect storage → smelter to supply iron ore
- Connect smelter → storage to collect iron bars
- Chain connections for complex production lines

## Future Enhancements
- Right-click connections to delete them
- Adjust transfer speeds
- Different connection types (pipes for fluids, belts for items)
- Visual resource flow animation along connections

# SETTLE — Card Art Prompts

## Overview

This document contains image generation prompts for creating card artwork. Each deck has a distinct visual style, but all cards feel like they belong to the same game world.

---

## General Art Direction

### World Aesthetic
- **Era:** Pre-industrial, frontier settlement
- **Mood:** Hopeful but harsh, survival with beauty
- **Palette:** Earthy, natural, muted with occasional vibrant accents
- **Style:** Painterly illustration, not photorealistic, not cartoonish
- **Influences:** Classic board game art, Settlers of Catan, illustrated field guides

### Consistency Rules
- Same horizon line height across cards
- Consistent lighting (warm afternoon sun, or overcast)
- Human figures when present are small, showing scale
- Nature dominates — buildings feel temporary against the land

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR CLAUDE

When generating card art:

1. **Maintain consistency** — All cards should feel like they're from the same world
2. **Follow the aesthetic** — Painterly, frontier, not photorealistic
3. **Match the mood** — Each card has a specific feeling
4. **Respect the frame** — Art should fit within card borders
5. **Consider readability** — Title text needs clear space
6. **Use the deck style** — Location=map feel, Standard=practical, Chance=mystical, Wildcard=ethereal

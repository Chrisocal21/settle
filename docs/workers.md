# SETTLE — Workers

## Overview

Workers are not just numbers — they're the heart of your economy. **When your workers are gone, the game is over.**

Everything feeds back to keeping them alive and loyal:
- Food keeps them fed
- Housing keeps them sheltered
- Hazards threaten them
- Your choices affect their morale
- Neglect them → they leave → you collapse

---

## Worker Grades

Workers come in different skill levels.

| Grade | Role | Value | Housing Needed |
|-------|------|-------|----------------|
| Laborer | Basic extraction, building | Common, cheap | Basic Shelter |
| Skilled | Runs refineries, processors | Worth more | Worker Quarters or better |
| Specialist | Advanced buildings, rare tech | Expensive, high output | Specialist Quarters |
| Leader | Boosts nearby workers | Rare | Skilled Housing or better |

---

## Worker States

Workers have morale that affects their behavior.

| State | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Happy | Full productivity, may give gifts, teaches you things |
| Content | Normal work, nothing special |
| Restless | "We need growth" — pressure to expand or build |
| Hungry | Productivity tanks, might leave soon |
| Leaving | About to go — last chance to fix things |
| Gone | Left the empire |

### The Loyalty Curve

```
Happy → Content → Restless → Leaving → Mass Exodus
                     ↑
              (you can pull them back here)
```

**It's a mixed spiral:**
- Things go bad → some workers get restless
- You fix it (food, shelter, better conditions) → they calm down
- You ignore it → a few leave
- Still ignore it → more leave, morale drops faster
- Hit a tipping point → avalanche, hard to recover

**But you CAN turn it around** — the game rewards recovery.

## What Workers Need

| Need | How to meet it |
|------|----------------|
| Food | Provisions from kitchen (Food + Water) |
| Housing | Appropriate shelter for their grade |
| Safety | Protection from hazards |
| Purpose | Work to do |
| Growth | Expansion, new buildings, progress |

---

## How Workers Arrive

Workers arrive based on what you've created — **you attract, not recruit.**

| What you build | Who shows up |
|----------------|--------------|
| Basic shelter + work available | Laborers just appear (auto-fill) |
| Better housing + refinery running | Skilled workers start arriving |
| Advanced buildings + good conditions | Specialists might show up (rare) |

**Card events can also bring workers:**

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| "Migrants arrive" | Bonus laborers show up |
| "Skilled Arrival" | A skilled worker joins if you have housing |
| "The Specialist" | Rare high-value worker, demands good conditions |
| "Worker shortage" (hazard) | Some workers leave or won't come |

---

## Worker Death

Workers can die. Death is environmental, not from other players.

| Cause | How it happens |
|-------|----------------|
| Starvation | No food for too long |
| Hazard events | Flood, fire, collapse, disease |
| Work danger | Mining accident, hunting gone wrong |
| Natural causes | Older workers eventually pass |

**Workers DON'T die from other players.** No one can attack or kill your workers directly.

---

## When Workers Leave

When workers leave, they don't help your opponents — they just disappear.

| What happens | Why it's designed this way |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Workers leave | They disappear from the game |
| You stabilize | Workers who left see you recovered |
| They ask to return | "Hey boss, things look better — room for us?" |
| You accept or decline | Costs resources to re-onboard |

**This prevents:**
- One player's collapse snowballing another player's advantage
- Feeling completely screwed by early mistakes
- Rage quits from unfair mechanics

---

## Returning Workers

When workers ask to come back, you evaluate:

- What grade are they?
- Do I have housing for them?
- Can I afford to feed them?
- Do I even need that role right now?

**Examples:**
> "3 laborers want to return. You have housing for 2."

> "1 specialist is asking to come back. Costs 50 provisions to re-onboard but doubles your refinery output."

## AI Worker Dialogue

Workers have **procedurally generated personalities** and can talk to you.

### Worker Attributes (Generated Each Game)

| Attribute | How it varies |
|-----------|---------------|
| Name | Random pool, fits the world |
| Personality | Grumpy, optimistic, nervous, stoic, chatty, quiet |
| Dialogue style | Short/blunt, friendly, formal |
| Traits | Works faster, eats more, loyal, flighty, etc. |

### Talk to Any Worker Anytime

You can always talk to workers. But what you GET depends on the relationship:

| Worker state | What they say |
|--------------|---------------|
| Unhappy | Short, cold, no help — "What do you want?" |
| Neutral | Basic info, nothing special — "Things are fine I guess" |
| Content | Start opening up — "You know, I've noticed something..." |
| Happy | Real advice, tips, hints — "Let me show you a trick" |
| Loyal | Perks, cards, secrets — "I trust you. Here's something I've been saving" |

### Workers Teach You Things

This is a core mechanic. **Patient players who invest in worker relationships get secret advantages.**

| What workers can share | Examples |
|------------------------|----------|
| Expansion hints | "The soil is richer to the east" |
| Efficiency tips | "Connect the smelter THIS way for 20% more output" |
| Rare blueprints | "I know how to build something. Want me to teach you?" |
| Perk cards | "I've been saving this for someone I trust" |

**The players who rush might win sometimes. The players who listen to their workers get wildcards and knowledge others don't have.**

---

## Worker Examples (Procedural Generation)

Each worker is unique:

> **"Frank"** — Grumpy laborer, blunt dialogue. Been with you 10 turns, high loyalty. Won't leave easily. Doesn't give tips but works hard.

> **"Sara"** — Optimistic skilled worker, chatty. Gives good production hints when happy. But flighty trait — first sign of trouble, she might bounce.

> **"Old Mitchell"** — Stoic specialist, formal dialogue. High skill, high maintenance. If you earn his trust, he'll teach you a rare blueprint.

## Worker Relationship Milestones

Trust builds over turns if conditions are met.

| Milestone | What triggers it | Reward type |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| First conversation | You talk to them | Opens dialogue |
| Settled in | 5 turns employed, needs met | Basic tips |
| Trusted | 10 turns, consistently happy | Better advice |
| Loyal | 20+ turns, never abandoned them | Perk cards, blueprints, secrets |

---

## Population as Victory Condition

Population growth is variable, not guaranteed.

| Conditions | What might happen |
|------------|-------------------|
| Good food, good housing, happy workers | More likely to grow |
| Bare minimum survival | Maybe grow, maybe not |
| Struggling, low morale | Probably not growing |
| Crisis mode | People leaving, not joining |

**You can't game it.** Build the conditions, then hope.

---

## Design Intent

Workers aren't just a resource to manage — they're **your people**. The game asks:

- Do I hoard resources for myself or share with workers?
- Do I push them hard for short-term gains?
- Do I take time to listen, or rush to expand?

**The right move for you should be the right move for them.** When those things conflict, the game gets interesting.

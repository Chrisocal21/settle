# SETTLE — Game Modes & Settings

## Overview

Settle supports multiple ways to play — solo survival, real-time multiplayer, async "play when you can" matches. All tunable in the lobby.

---

## Core Game Modes

### Standard Mode
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Starting conditions | Everyone equal — basic shelter, few workers, small stockpile |
| Who it's for | Default competitive play |

### Custom Loadout Mode
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Starting conditions | Players pick starting resources/buildings within a budget |
| Who it's for | Private games, experienced players |

---

## Player Count

**Flexible — map scales to players.**

| Players | Map size | Game length tendency |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| 2 | Small | Faster, head to head |
| 3-4 | Medium | Sweet spot |
| 5-6 | Large | Longer, more chaos |

Map generates based on lobby size. More players = more territory = longer to dominate.

---

## Solo Mode

**Pure survival — you vs. the world.**

| Feature | How it works |
|---------|--------------|
| Opponents | None — just you, your workers, the decks |
| Enemy | The world itself — hazards, scarcity, depletion |
| Win condition | Complete the land (extract everything, build everything) |
| Alternative | See how long you last — high score based on turns survived |
| Purpose | Practice, chill sessions, quick plays |

Solo mode removes the competitive element but keeps all the survival mechanics.

## Multiplayer: Real-Time

**Everyone online together.**

| Feature | How it works |
|---------|--------------|
| Presence | All players online simultaneously |
| Flip phase | Turn-based, leader goes first |
| Management phase | Everyone acts at once in real-time |
| Trading | Live negotiation |
| Tension | High — watching others flip, reacting immediately |
| Session length | Must complete in one sitting |

---

## Multiplayer: Async

**Take turns when you can — like Words With Friends.**

| Feature | How it works |
|---------|--------------|
| Presence | Players take turns over hours/days |
| Notifications | "Your turn in Settle - Frozen North" |
| Multiple games | Play several matches at once |
| Trading | Propose → wait for response → resolve |
| Tension | Different — "what did they do while I was gone" |
| Session length | Can span days or weeks |

**A "4 hour game" might actually span days of real time** with each player taking their turn when available.

## Tutorial

**There is no tutorial.**

| Philosophy | Reasoning |
|------------|-----------|
| Learn by dying | First game might be 10 minutes — that's fine |
| Workers guide you | AI dialogue = soft hints |
| Get better each playthrough | Mastery feels earned |
| No hand-holding | Sink or swim, old school |

The worker AI becomes your tutorial — treat them right, they'll teach you. Ignore them, you die confused.

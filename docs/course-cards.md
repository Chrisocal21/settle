# SETTLE — Course Cards

## Overview

Course Cards are flipped at the start of each game. They set the world — terrain layout, resource distribution, hazard tendencies.

**Every game is a different "golf course."** Same rules, completely different challenge.

---

## How Course Cards Work

1. Before the game starts, flip (or select) a Course Card
2. The course determines:
   - What terrain dominates the map
   - Which resources are common vs. scarce
   - Which hazards are more likely
   - Overall difficulty and game length tendency
3. All players share the same course — fair starting positions

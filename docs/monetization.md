# SETTLE — Monetization

## Core Principle

**Cosmetic only. Hard line. No pay-to-win.**

Players who pay money have prettier games. They do NOT have better chances of winning.

## Gold Coins (Premium Currency)

Real money purchases gold coins. Gold coins purchase cosmetics.

| Purchase tier | Gold coins | Notes |
|---------------|------------|-------|
| Small | 100 | Try it out |
| Medium | 500 | Regular player |
| Large | 1200 | Best value |
| Jumbo | 3000 | Collector/supporter |

## What Gold Coins DO NOT Buy

**Absolutely no gameplay advantage:**

| NOT purchasable | Why |
|-----------------|-----|
| Resources | Would be pay-to-win |
| Workers | Would be pay-to-win |
| Gameplay wildcards | Would be pay-to-win |
| Extra flips | Would be pay-to-win |
| Better starting positions | Would be pay-to-win |
| Skip hazards | Would be pay-to-win |
| Anything that affects winning | HARD LINE |

---

## Earned vs. Purchased Wildcards

Two completely separate pools:

| Pool | How you get them | What they do |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| **Earned wildcards** | Found in-game through luck, milestones, worker gifts | Real gameplay advantage — resources, tools, buffs |
| **Purchased wildcards** | Buy with gold coins | Cosmetic ONLY — sparkly versions, same effect |

A purchased wildcard might be:
- A golden version of a resource stack (looks fancy, same amount)
- Animated card art
- Special visual effect when played
- Collectible border

**Zero gameplay difference.** Someone who pays has a prettier game, not a better chance of winning.

---

## Not Tradeable

Purchased items cannot be traded between players:

| Not tradeable | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Skins | Prevents gray market |
| Cosmetic wildcards | You bought it, it's yours |
| Card backs | No resale economy |
| Themes | Keeps it simple |
| Any gold coin purchase | Hard line |

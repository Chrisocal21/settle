# SETTLE — Card Decks

## Overview

Cards are how the world unfolds — not your toolkit. You don't "play" cards to build things. Cards reveal territory, spawn resources, trigger hazards, and create events.

**You flip cards. The world changes. You react.**

---

## The Four Card Types

| Deck | What it does | Risk level | When to pick |
|------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| **Location Deck** | Reveals new territory at your edge | Low-medium | When you need to expand |
| **Standard Deck** | Resources, events, hazards | Medium | Everyday flip |
| **Chance Deck** | Big swings, high stakes | High | When you're desperate or brave |
| **Wildcard Pool** | Loot drops that find you | Earned | Not a deck — rewards come to you |

---

## Flip Rules

**On your turn:**
1. You MUST flip from one deck (your choice which)
2. Some cards grant bonus flips — use them or gift them to another player
3. Skip cards exist but must be earned/held
4. Turn order: Leader flips first (most exposed)

**When you flip:**
- You pick the deck
- You flip the top card
- Card resolves — might hit just you, everyone, or neighbors
- Then management phase begins (everyone acts)

## Card Resolution

| Card scope | Who it affects |
|------------|----------------|
| Personal | Just you (resource appears at YOUR edge) |
| Local hazard | Just you (raiders hit YOUR mine) |
| Global event | Everyone (drought, market crash, plague) |
| Neighbor | Affects you and adjacent players |
| Choice | You pick who it hits |
